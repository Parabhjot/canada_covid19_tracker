Tracking Covid19 cases in Canada through Maps, Tables, and Plots
App running on: https://parabhjot.shinyapps.io/canada_covid_19_tracker/

I wanted to make an easy way to track Covid19 cases in Canada. 
This app automatically updates as new datafiles are uploaded by the Canadian government and displays the information in an interactive map, informative table, and in plots showing linear and logistic growth.
